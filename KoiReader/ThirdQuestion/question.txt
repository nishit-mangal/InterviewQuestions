For Nodejs/backend developers :-
Make a GET request to https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/lang/es and store the response in a file.
Add a retry logic if the request fails for some reason.
For retrying - Use asyncjs library or implement it yourself.
For GET request choose any of the following -

i. superagent (https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent)
ii. request (https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)
iii. got (https://www.npmjs.com/package/got)
