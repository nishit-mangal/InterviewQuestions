Problem 2 -->
  
    Given an array Arr[] that contains N integers (may be positive, negative or zero). 
    Find the product of the maximum product subarray.
    
    Example 1:
    
    Input:
    N = 5
    Arr[] = {6, -3, -10, 0, 2}    == 6, 6, 
    Output: 180
    Explanation: Subarray with maximum product
    is [6, -3, -10] which gives product as 180.
    
Problem 1 --->

    Given an array arr[] and an integer k where k is smaller than the size of the array,
    the task is to find the kth smallest element in the given array.
    It is given that all array elements are distinct.
    
    Note:-  l and r denotes the starting and ending index of the array.
    
    Example 1:
    
    Input:
    N = 6
    arr[] = 7 10 4 3 20 15
    K = 3
    L=0 R=5
    
    Output : 
    7
    Explanation :
    3rd smallest element in the given 
    array is 7.
