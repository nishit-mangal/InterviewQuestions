Q1. Given a 2D plane - 2xN 


Fill the entire plane using the 2 given Biscuits types. Find out in how many ways you can fill the entire plane. 


Let numOfCol = 9 

Let arr = Array(numOfCol+1) 

Arr[0] = 0, arr[1] = 1, arr[2] = 2 

Solve(3) 


Function baseFunction(numOfColumn){ 

	If(numOfColumn<=2) 

		return arr[numOfColumn] 

	Return Solve(3) 

} 

 
Function solve(index){ 

	If(index> numOfCol) 

		return arr[numOfCol] 

	Arr[index] =  arr[n-1] + arr[n-2] 

	Return Solve(index+1) 

}
